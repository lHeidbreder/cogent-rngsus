Commands:
The bot listens to messages that start with a dollar sign ($).
A list of available commands are accessible under the '$info' command.

Further commands are:
--$roll-- / --$r--
Takes up to two parameters and a single option.
No parameters will roll a single d6 and tell you the result.
One parameter ($r x) will roll an amount of x d6 and count successes. This is what is used most often for combat.
One parameter and the '+' option ($r x+) will roll an amount of x d6 and count successes, also counting 3s as a success as described by the destiny point rules.
One parameter and the 'd' option ($r xd) will roll an amount of x d6 and sum up the eyes.
One parameter and the '~' option ($r x~) will roll an amount of x d6 and evaluate the average.
Two parameters ($r x y) will roll an amount of x d6 against a challenge level of y. This is what will be most commonly used during exploration.
Two parameters and the '+' option ($r x+ y) will roll an amount of x d6 against a challenge level of y, counting 3s as successes as described by the destiny point rules.

--$prob-- / --$p--
Takes up to two parameters and a single option, very similar to '$roll'.
One parameter ($p x) will give you the estimated amount of successes when rolling x d6.
One parameter and the '+' option ($p x+) will give you the estimated amount of successes when rolling x d6, counting 3s as successes as described by the destiny point rules.
One parameter and the 'd' option ($p xd) will give you a range of what sum you can expect when rolling x d6.
Two parameters ($p x y) will give you the chance of succeeding at a roll of x d6 against a challenge level of y.
Two parameters and the '+' option ($p x+ y) will give you the chance of succeeding at a roll of x d6 against a challenge level of y, counting 3s as successes as described by the destiny point rules.

--$become-- / --$iam--
Takes one parameter.
Changes how the bot will address you. Also it is necessary to take your character's name if it was uploaded to take control of it.
Multiple users can take the same name, allowing them to control the same character.

--$tellme--
Takes one parameter. ($tellme x)
If you are controlling a character, this will tell you the desired stat, specified by x.

--$damage-- / --$dmg--
Takes one parameter ($dmg x). Counterpart to '$heal'.
If you are controlling a character, this will add an injury of the severity specified by x. For example '$dmg 2' will add a medium injury.

--$heal--
Takes one parameter ($heal x). Counterpart to '$dmg'.
If you are controlling a character, this will remove an injury of the severity specified by x. For example '$heal 2' will heal one medium injury.

--$keys--
Gives you all registered keys in the database. Not part of the info dialog. Used mainly for debugging.

--$clear db now--
Clears the whole database. Not part of the info dialog. Use with caution.


Further, the bot can handle a character table. Fill out the csv table added called "characters.csv" and upload it to a server where the bot can receive it.
