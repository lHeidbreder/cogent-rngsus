<h4><u>Warning</u>: This is not functional yet! I still have to replace replit's database</h4>
A small dice bot and character manager, made for simple use on any server.

Intended usage:

1. Create a shell for the bot (in the Discord developer portal) and add it to your server
2. Copy the bot's token
3. Create a environment variable with the key 'RNGSUS_TOKEN' and the token as the value
4. Download the source code
5. Start main.py

Assuming you have a python interpreter, everything should work as intended
