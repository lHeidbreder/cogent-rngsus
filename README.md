# cogent-rngsus

A small dice bot and character manager, made for simple use on any server.

Intended usage:

1. Download the source code
2. Create a shell for the bot (in the Discord developer portal) and add it to your server
3. Copy the bot's token
4. Run the setup script that is appropriate for your system
5. If something went wrong, create an environment variable with the key 'RNGSUS_TOKEN' and the token as the value. This will make it more convenient to start the bot.
6. Run main.py from the commandline
